                      draft-farrell-tls-pemesni-07

Abstract

   Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) key pairs need to be configured into TLS
   servers, that can be built using different TLS libraries, so there is
   a benefit and little cost in documenting a file format to use for
   these key pairs, similar to how RFC7468 defines other PEM file
   formats.

1.  Introduction

   Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) [I-D.ietf-tls-esni] for TLS1.3 [RFC8446]
   defines a confidentiality mechanism for server names and other
   ClientHello content in TLS.  That requires publication of an
   ECHConfigList data structure in an HTTPS or SVCB RR
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https] in the DNS.  An ECHConfigList can contain
   one or more ECHConfig values.  An ECHConfig structure contains the
   public component of a key pair that will typically be periodically
   (re-)generated by some key manager for a TLS server.  TLS servers
   then need to be configured to use these key pairs, and given that
   various TLS servers can be built with different TLS libraries, there
   is a benefit in having a standard format for ECH key pairs, just as
   was done with [RFC7468].

   [[At present, based on TLS WG list discussion, it seems most likely
   that this draft will be sent to the Independent stream once ECH is
   done and dusted (but not before).  The source for this is in
   https://github.com/sftcd/pemesni/ PRs are welcome there too.]]

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  ECHConfig file

   The public and private keys MUST both be PEM encoded.  The file
   contains the catenation of the PEM encoding of the private key
   followed by the PEM encoding of the public key as an ECHConfigList
   containing exactly one ECHConfig.  The private key MUST be encoded as
   a PKCS#8 PrivateKey.  The public key MUST be the base64 encoded form
   of an ECHConfigList value that can also be published in the DNS.  The

Internet-Draft           PEM file format for ECH                May 2024


   string "ECHCONFIG" MUST be used in the PEM file delimiter for the
   public key.

   There MUST only be one key pair in each file even if a server
   publishes multiple public keys in the DNS in one ECHConfigList
   structure.

4.  Security Considerations

   Storing cryptographic keys in files leaves them vulnerable should
   anyone get shell access to the TLS server machine.  So: Don't let
   that happen:-)

5.  Acknowledgements

   TBD, as needed

6.  IANA Considerations

   There are none so this section can be deleted later.
